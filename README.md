Epidemic Management System
The aim of this project is to design and develop a database for the public health administration and other multi-lateral agencies supporting epidemic response. These sectors can now use the efficient and organized data to tackle high level threats. The plan is to create a nexus with details such as patient records (such as contact and registration), availability of assets, migrant details along with an idea on the current statistics of the epidemic.
